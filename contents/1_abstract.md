Water distribution system is one of the most expensive and complicated infrastructure systems on which the modern society relies for a sustainable supply of water. The task of obtaining an optimal operating strategy for water distribution can be tricky. In this report we have used a Mixed Integer Linear Programming method for solving the Suez Town Water Distribution Network problem of building the most cost-effective 24-hour schedule while maintaining an unchanged water capacity at the end of an operating cycle.  Both the electricity tariff and consumer demand has varied considerably through the operating cycle. Apart from this, several other factors like static lift of the pump, and suction pressure of the tanks have been maintained as constant in this study. Pipes are assumed to be frictionless. Individual pump characteristic and the hydraulics of the network has not been considered. The topography of Suez Town is not quite evident, however there is a difference in elevation in the water source and demand locations. A cost benefit analysis has also been carried out by upgrading one of the infrastructures, and by projecting growth of population at 10% every year. By way of conclusion, this analysis also helps us to investigate and understand the importance of each assets. It helps us to reflect on which asset should be prioritized to be upgraded to meet the growing population demand for water.
